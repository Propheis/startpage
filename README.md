# Start Page - A custom dashboard for your browser

## Configuration
In order to use this app you will need to create a `config.js` file. You can do this by copying `sample-config.js`, and editing it to suit your needs. There are comments in the sample file which explain configuring the project. You'll also need an API key from [DarkSky](https://darksky.net) in order to utilize the weather functions.

## Running the App
```
cd /path/to/project/folder
npm start
```
